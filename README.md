My name is Louis Cordier.
I am 26 years old and live between Marseille and Aix-en-Provence, France.

I have a bachelor degree in Geography and Land planning.

I also have the first year of a master degree in Urbanism and urban planning.

I recently decided to redirect to Information Technology (IT).

I'm currently studying in the school LaPlateforme in Marseille,
in the first year of a Bachelor degree in IT.

It's my first year in this structure where I study programming.
I learn informatic languages like HTML, CSS. 

I also started learning Linux and virtual machines.

I have choosen a speciality in late december : I am now a student in software development.

I am looking for a work-study program, in my field of specialty (software development).
If possible, it would start in September 2025, ideally in Aix, Marseille or nearby areas.
